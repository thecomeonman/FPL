It's a pain to identify stretches of appealing fixtures. The coloured
indicators that FPL tacked on in 2016-17 don't seem to update with
performances.

The charts below try to highlight four aspects that one would typically
look for when trying to decide transfers.

The thresholds, etc. aren't some sort of recommendation. Feel free to
change them if some other number makes more sense.

PS1: I might update this every week or not. PS2: I think this code
should be okay with double gameweeks. If it isn't, 'll try and fix it at
the earliest.
